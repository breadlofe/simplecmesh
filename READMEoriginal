This software package contains a family of discrete-event simulators based on the C
programming language.  The current and planned contents of the package are as follows:

Currently available:

	YACSIM - A process-oriented discrete-event simulator implemented as an extension
	of the C programming language.	This simulator has been used extensively for 
	several years.  It is stable and relatively free of bugs.  There is a reference 
	manual included in the package. 

	NETSIM - A general-purpose interconnection network simulator implemented as 
	an extension of YACSIM.  This simulator is relatively new and has only recently
	been made available outside Rice.  It has not been used much and almost 
	certainly contains some bugs, although we have fixed all we know about.  There
	is a reference manual included in the package.

	DBSIM - A debugging utility for use with any of the simulators.  This program
	is operational and documented.  There are no known bugs, but it has not been
	extensively tested.

Not yet available:

	MEMSIM - A cache and shared address space memory simulator implemented as an
	extension of YACSIM.  This simulator is currently being extensively revised and
	is not yet avaiable.  Our goal is to have a version we can distribute by the 
	end of the summer of 1993.

	PARCSIM - A parallel architecture simulator implemented as an extension of 
	YACSIM and including both YACSIM and MEMSIM.  Parts of PARCSIM are operational
	but it is not complete and not yet ready for distribution.  We hope to have a
	version that includes NETSIM, but not MEMSIM, available by the middle of the 
	summer of 1993.  It would be suitable for simulating distributed memory systems.

The simulators in this package can be freely used for any research purpose subject to 
the above copyright conditions.  I would appreciate receiving a copy of any report or 
paper describing reseach results that were obtained using any of the simulators and 
which references our work. 

If you are using any of these simulators or are interested in using then, I would also 
like to know about your intended use, any problems you may have with then, and any 
general comments or suggestions you may have.  If you respond, I will add your name to a 
list of users and keep you informed by email of any changes or updates that become 
available.  

All software and documentation is in the file sim.tar.Z.  To unpack it type "uncompress
sim.tar.Z" to get sim.tar.  Then type "tar xf sim.tar" to get the actual files.  This
creates a directory called simdir that contains the complete package in several sub-
directories.  

To install YACSIM, NETSIM, and DBSIM, edit the first part of the makefile in the directory 
simdir as indicated in the file itself.  Then type "make yacsim" to make YACSIM, 
"make netsim" to make NETSIM, or "make dbsim" to make DBSIM.  Type "make all" or just "make"
to make all three.  Since NETSIM is an extension of YACSIM and contains everything in 
YACSIM, it is not necessary to make both.   You could just make NETSIM and use it for all your
simulations.  The only reason to make and use YACSIM without the NETSIM extensions is that the
object files made with YACSIM are a little smaller than those made with NETSIM.

There are some sample YACSIM and NETSIM programs in the directories yacsimdir/testy 
and yacsimdir/testn.  Their source code is in the src subdirectories and the outputs 
they produce are in the dataout subdirectories.  To install them, go to directories 
testn and/or testy and type "make."  Type "runtest" to run them and compare their 
outputs to the output files in the dataout subdirectories.
